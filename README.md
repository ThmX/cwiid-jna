CWiid & Java Native Access (JNA)
================================
This tutorial briefly shows how to use the CWiid library in Scala through the JNA library.

### Libraries

The installation of the CWiid library is explained on [their website](http://abstrakraft.org/cwiid).
* CWiid 0.6.00
* JNA 4.0.0
* JNAerator 0.12-SNAPSHOT 20130727

### Mapping between C and Java

In order to use the CWiid library, we will have to map the C library.
The mapping will be done using JNAerator and it will generate a JAR file.
The following figure shows what configuration was used:

![JNAerator](https://github.com/ThmX/cwiid-jna/raw/master/jnaerator.png "JNAerator")

`cwiid.h` was tweaked to avoid having to import `bluetooth.h` which was producing errors.

```c
// #include <bluetooth/bluetooth.h>	/* bdaddr_t */
typedef struct {
	uint8_t b[6];
} __attribute__((packed)) bdaddr_t;
```

Finally, the `cwiid.jar` will be generated.

## Example

#### Scala

[scala source](https://github.com/ThmX/cwiid-jna/blob/master/cwiid.scala)

Compile & run the code above using the following commands, don't forget to place the libraries in the same directory.

	scalac -cp jna.jar:jnaerator.jar:cwiid.jar cwiid.scala
	scala -cp .:jna.jar:jnaerator.jar:cwiid.jar CWiid
